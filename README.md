This project is a minimalistic Machine Learning (ML) framework developed in C++, focusing on linear regression. It includes basic data handling through a custom DataFrame class and implements linear regression modeling with gradient descent optimization. This framework is designed as a learning tool to understand the fundamentals of ML algorithms and data manipulation in C++.

The project structure comprises:
- 'DataFrame.h': A header file defining the DataFrame class for loading and manipulating datasets from CSV files.
- 'LinearRegression.h': A header file defining the LinearRegression class, which implements the fitting (training) and prediction logic for linear regression.
- 'main.cpp': The main program demonstrating the usage of DataFrame and LinearRegression with a simple dataset.
